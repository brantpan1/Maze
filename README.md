# Maze Solver

## Welcome
Welcome to Maze Solver, a Java project that enables you to navigate through different types of mazes and solve them using various algorithms.

## Features

### Premade Mazes
There are 4 premade mazes available:
- 100 X 60
- 100 X 60 with vertical bias
- 100 X 60 with horizontal bias
- 10 X 10 for testing manual mode
- You can also create a custom-sized maze.

### Navigation Options
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Press 'b'
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Press 'd'
- **Manual Mode**: Press 'm'
- Once you choose a mode, you can't switch. To skip the BFS and DFS animations, press 's' again.

### Movement Controls
Use the arrow keys to move around the maze.

### Create New Maze
Press 'r' to generate a new random maze of the same size.

### Color Modes
Switch between different color modes:
- Normal
- Heatmap with the top-left corner being the bluest
- Heatmap with the bottom-right corner being the bluest
Press 'c' to switch color modes.

### Size Limitation
Note that you can't create a maze larger than 100 X 60.

Enjoy exploring the mazes and solving them using various algorithms!
